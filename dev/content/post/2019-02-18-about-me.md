I am a veteran cloud architect with a passion for serverless architecture.

Although I consider myself an architect, I'm very hands-on. I've designed and built systems from early Raspberry Pis, up to IBM mainframes and almost everything in between. Most of the code I write these days is unfortunately in private repos, as it is built for commercial use, but you are welcome to view my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/RIMikeC).

I have amassed extensive management, mentoring and technical leadership experience.  I love working in retail and my previous corporate clients have included many of the UK’s most loved retail brands, including John Lewis, Specsavers, and Selfridges.

Here is the complete collection of companies I've worked for:

 - BP
 - IBM
 - Nomura
 - Standard Chartered Bank
 - Sun Microsystems
 - Sequent
 - Fujitsu
 - Carphone
 - EDF
 - Selfridges
 - JL
 - RI
 - Sansburys
 - Primark
 - River Island

I hold a BSc in Computer Science from Manchester University, but I have steered away from chasing professional qualifications, as I find pratical experience more useful.

I am currently working for the new technology arm of [River Island](https://www.ritechstyle.com/). I am happy with my current job, but also willing to take new challenges if the opportunity matches his career path.
