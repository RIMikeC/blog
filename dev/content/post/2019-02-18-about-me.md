I am a veteran cloud architect with a passion for serverless architecture.

Although I consider myself an architect, I'm very hands-on. I've designed and built systems from early Raspberry Pis, up to IBM mainframes and almost everything in between. Most of the code I write these days is unfortunately in private repos, as it is built for commercial use, but you are welcome to view my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/RIMikeC).

I have amassed extensive management, mentoring and technical leadership experience.  I love working in retail and my previous corporate clients have included many of the UK’s most loved retail brands, including John Lewis, Specsavers, and Selfridges.

I hold a BSc in Computer Science from Manchester University, but I have steered away from chasing professional qualifications, as I find pratical experience more useful.

I am currently working for the new technology arm of [River Island](https://www.ritechstyle.com/). I am happy with my current job, but also willing to take new challenges if an interesting opportunity arises.
