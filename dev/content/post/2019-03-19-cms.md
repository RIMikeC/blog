# Blog Technology Part II

Just as there is with [blog hosting](http://mikecharl.es/2019/02/20/blog-tech/), there are thousands of different software options for content management systems (CMS).

I knew that my requirements were so simple that there was no way it would make sense for me to do anything other than build up something simple for myself from scratch. Plus, I had a secret weapon when it came to this part of my blog project - [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

### Hugo

Hugo is open source software used to build static websites. It's gained popularity quickly because it massively speeds up people like me who just want to concentrate on the content and not bother with endless javascript and CSS bug-fixing. I may write another blog post about hugo some other time. For now, just know that with a single command you can get hugo to build a website from [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), fire up a web server, or check your site for errors.

So, my laziness has taken over and I've got to the point now where I everything I need to do with my content is just one command. I use [Github](https://github.com) as my git repository for all the markdown, I edit locally on my laptop, then one command to push back to the repo, or another single command to fire up a local web server for testing. Once I'm happy with the content, it's just one command to push the page or image to the live server ie the s3 bucket.

For example, to build a test web server I use
````shell
make test
````

To build the live server from my local version -
````shell
make prod
````

Here's the relevant part of the Makefile -
````
prod:	dev/content/post dev/static
	( cd prod ; rm -rf * )							# Remove everything in prod
	( cd dev  ; hugo -t hugo-theme-cleanwhite -d ../prod )			# Build a website from dev
	( cd prod ; aws s3 sync . s3://mikecharl.es/ --region eu-west-1 )	# Push changes to s3 bucket
````

## Conclusion
Content management is easy when you have only one developer working alone. Hugo makes it even easier. 
If you don't have a copy of Hugo in your toolset, then download it now; it's open source, fast and it works.
