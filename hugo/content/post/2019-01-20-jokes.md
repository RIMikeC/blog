I argued with my wife in a lift.   
I was wrong on so many levels.  
   
I'm letting other people dot the Is.    
But cross the Ts; that's where I draw the line.   
   
I told my wife that she should embrace her mistakes.    
Then she gave me hug.   
   
Seeing my dog in the sea makes me proud.    
He's a very good bouy.   
   
I read that the arabs invented the concept of zero.   
Well, thanks for nothing.
