      <description>Blog Technology Part II Just as there is with blog hosting, there are thousands of different software options for content management systems (CMS).

      <description>Blog Technology  I decided at the start of this year to get a presence for myself in the web. Here were my requirements: - Must be able to host the occassional blog post (static content only) - Must require minimal maintenance - Must have a modern, clean look and feel - Must provide a reasonable user experience - Must cost less that a cup of coffee per month - Should offer good availability, but does not have to be 24x7 I thought when I wrote all these down that I would have several different options and that I&amp;rsquo;d spend some time getting each of them working, then maybe get some of the UX guys at work to pick a favourite.</description>

      <title>What Is Serverless?</title>

      <description>What is Serverless? Serverless computing is a service, that runs your code for you on a server that it determines. Although your code runs on a server, the term &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo; is used as the person who writes the code does not need to know anything about the server.
It&amp;rsquo;s a confusing term. There are servers in a serverless environment, of course there are. However, there is a clear separation of responsibilities between the people who manage the servers and the people who write the code that runs on them.</description>
